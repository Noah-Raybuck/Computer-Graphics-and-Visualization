I approach designing software one step at time. I usually start with planning and designing before jumping into any kind of coding. This is especially true when working with new features or programs I've never used before. This course has made put emphasis on the planning and designing portion of this process. Planning things out when creating a 3D enviroment is crucial before you even begin to put lines of code in.


Developing programs is also something I would take in various steps. It's important not to try and do too many things at once and spread yourself thin. While working on the project my main focus was to just complete one shape at a time, even smaller than that it was to create one face at a time and make sure it was properly displayed and in the correct position.


This course has given me experience I never even knew I could have and I'm sure that all the skills and knowledge I earned in this course will pay off greatly in the future when it comes to achieving my goals and finishing up my education.
